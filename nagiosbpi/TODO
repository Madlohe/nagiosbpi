ToDo List for NagiosBPI


MODEL/DATA:
- fix bug for when a single service is "warning," the group is only at warning, not critical
- add hosts checks to selectable options 

VIEW/INTERFACE:
- create popout to allow view both direct child and recursive statistics 

LOGIC/CONTROLLER:
- create sortability by service, status, or group priority 

MISC:

FEATURE REQUESTS:
Would it be possible to propagate errors upwards in order of importance?

Let me explain better:

Instead of simple number of errors, propagate in order of gravity (warning or critical).

For example:
If a group is composed of three services, I might want to propagate a WARNING even when there are two services on error WARNING while I propagate a CRITICAL in presence of a single service to critical. 

When you're in configuration and you click the refresh (which now works), you risks to lose the data entered up to that time.

 
The refresh brings you to the main page while you are in configuration.
 
Maybe we should use a cache to return to the page you're working on.
